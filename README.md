# ics690-vikings-dapp
ICS690 semester project making a dapp to hypothetically make decisions on behalf of the GM of my favorite football team, the Minnesota Vikings

## (Ideal state) Rules of the DApp
- The people in the network are dubbed "SkolFaithful". To join SkolFaithful, one must pay the season ticket holder price of $500.
- There are three features SkolFaithful needs to vote on: Head coach hiring, free agents to sign, and Round 1 of the draft.
- For each feature, there will be five top proposed ideas in voting. These features are known as "The Podium". Minnesota Vikings Coins (MVC) distribution and REP tokens are outlined below

### (Ideal state) Minnesota Vikings Coins (MVCs) and REP Tokens
- Every new member of SkolFaithful gets 4 newly minted Minnesota Vikings Coins (MVCs).
- In order for someone in SkolFaithful to submit a proposal for a feature, they must pay 4 MVCs along with their choices.
- It costs 2 MVCs to vote for a proposal. A proposal counts as a vote without no additional MVC charge.
- For each feature, MVCs will be distributed in the following order:
    - Each person who voted for a proposal that ended up on The Podium receives 1 MVC.
    - Owner #1 receives 30% of remaining MVC.
    - Owner #2 receives 25% of remaining MVC.
    - Owner #3 receives 20% of remaining MVC.
    - Owner #4 receives 15% of remaining MVC.
    - Owner #5 receives 10% of remaining MVC.
    - Any MVCs contributing to proposals not on The Podium are destroyed!
- For each feature, newly minted REP tokens will be distributed as follows:
    - 1st and 2nd place owners receive 5 REP tokens
    - 3rd and 4th place owners receive 4 REP tokens
    - 5th place receives 3 REP token
    - Each person who voted for either one of the top two proposals receives 1 newly minted REP token 
- Any member of SkolFaithful that doesn't vote or submit a proposal for a feature loses 1 MVC and 1 REP token.
- Any member of SkolFaithful can buy 1 MVC for $100.
- Any member of SkolFaithful can trade in 1 REP token for 2 newly minted MVCs.


<!-- 150 total MVC, 100 MVC from the top 5 proposals (20 MVC from proposals, 80 from votes, 85 people)

150-85 (from rule 1) = 65 MVC left
65-20 (from rule 2 rounded up) = 45 MVC left
45-12 (from rule 3 rounded up) = 33 MVC left
33-7 (from rule 4 rounded up) = 26 MVC left
26-4 (from rule 5 rounded up) = 22 MVC left
22-3 (from rule 6 rounded up) = 19 MVC left
19 MVC burned (from rule 7) -->
